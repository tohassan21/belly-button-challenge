# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 Challenge
- This challenge explores the Bellybutton Biodiversity Dataset and creates an interactive dashboard to show the top OTUs (operational taxonomic units) present and the amount and type of bacteria present in each human sample.

Used Xpert Learning Assistant to assist me with:
- the difference between == and ===, should use == because it automatically converts data type whereas === accounts for data type but doesnt convert.
- converting the key values to uppercase in the demographic info section

How to run:
- Open the index.html file using LiveServer.
- Select a Test Subject ID Number using the dropdown to see its data.
